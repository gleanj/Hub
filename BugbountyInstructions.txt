HubSpot is an AI-powered customer platform with all the software, integrations, and resources that businesses need to connect their marketing, sales, and customer service.

For this program, we're inviting researchers to test HubSpot’s web applications and services with a focus of identifying security vulnerabilities that might lead to the compromise of our customer CRM records and data.

# Instructions for creating a HubSpot trial portal:
- Anyone may create a trial portal by navigating to: https://offers.hubspot.com/free-trial. When signing up, please use your @WEAREHACKERONE.COM email address.
- All available functionality may be tested with the exception of email sends to email addresses you do not own. Please note, sending phishing attacks or spam from a portal will be grounds for permanent disqualification.
- With a trial account, it is possible to create an API key to send API requests. Follow [these instructions](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/guides/apps/authentication/intro-to-auth) for creating an API key. API requests should fall within these [API usage guidelines](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/guides/apps/api-usage/usage-details).
- Information about HubSpot APIs, including example requests, is available at: https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/overview

## Beta Features:
We encourage researchers to test and submit any bugs or vulnerabilities you may identify within beta features.

# Special Reward and Bonus (CTF Challenge)
We created a portal with 1 contact record in the CRM. The record has 2 properties (`firstname` and a custom sensitive property called `super_secret`) that contain flags you need to obtain for this capture the flag challenge. Your task is to find permission-related vulnerabilities to bypass access controls (without any social engineering, user interaction, or brute-forcing) and read the `firstname` flag for a $15,000 USD special reward. Optionally, you may attempt to obtain the second `super_secret` flag for an additional $5,000 USD bonus, for a total of $20,000 USD potential reward.

The target domain for this challenge is `app.hubspot.com` and the target portal ID is `46962361`. **DO NOT attempt to access other portals you don’t own.** In order to be awarded the bounty, you must:
1. Provide the property name and value of the flag(s) obtained. For example: firstname = <contact’s first name>, super_secret = <contact’s super secret info>
2. Provide detailed reproduction steps so we can successfully validate the finding.
3. Email your submission ID to the email address specified in the contact record’s `email` property with the subject `HubSpot CTF Challenge`.

The first valid submission will be awarded the special reward. At that time, the CTF challenge will be paused while we remediate the finding and improve our defenses. Once done, we will modify the flags, make an announcement that we’re resuming the challenge, and update our bounty brief to indicate that the CTF is open again.

**_The standard HubSpot bug bounty program rules apply. Please take the time to read the entire bounty brief before attempting this challenge._**
**_HubSpot reserves the right to stop the CTF challenge, special reward, and bonus at any time without prior notice and reason._**

# Focus Areas
## Authentication flows
We highly encourage researchers to test various authentication flows including but not limited to:
- Signup (with email, Google, Apple, Microsoft)
- Login (with email, SSO, Google, Apple, Microsoft)
- MFA
- Account recovery / password reset
- OAuth

Researchers should approach these areas with a creative and critical mindset, exploring potential vulnerabilities that may lead to user account takeover and/or unauthorized access of data. Our goal is to ensure that our authentication mechanisms not only comply with industry standards but also demonstrate strong resilience against emerging threats and sophisticated attack techniques.

## High impact findings
Overall, we are most interested in critical vulnerabilities that allow access to customer CRM records and sensitive (PHI and PII) data, HubSpot’s corporate data, and our internal network. We highly encourage researchers to look for:
- Vulnerabilities (like cross-site scripting) that may lead to user account takeover
- Cross-portal data leakage and access; i.e. if you are authenticated and authorized to access portal A, you should not be able to read/modify data in portal B, unless you have also been authorized to that portal
- Server-side code execution vulnerabilities
- Sensitive data exposure

# Ratings and Rewards
For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program will use the [the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://www.hackerone.com/vulnerability-management/what-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-cvss). However, it is important to note that in some cases a vulnerability priority will be modified due to its likelihood and impact. In any instance where an issue is downgraded, a full, detailed explanation will be provided to the researcher.

To maximize your reward and minimize the payout time frame, please make sure to include the following in your report:
- An attack scenario: Provides context and demonstrates how the vulnerability can be exploited in real-world conditions.
- Clear reproduction steps: Helps ensure that the vulnerability can be consistently and reliably demonstrated.
- Recommended fix: Speeds up the mitigation process and reduces the time that the system remains exposed. Providing a practical solution also showcases the researcher’s understanding of the issue which enhances the credibility of the report.

In Scope Features
Customer portal
(1) The customer portal feature is in scope. However, testing on live customer portals is prohibited without explicit customer authorisation. Please set up your own instance in your test HubSpot account. For instructions, navigate to: https://knowledge.hubspot.com/inbox/set-up-a-customer-portal
Customer connected domain
(2) HubSpot Marketing and CMS customers often host content on the HubSpot platform. Customer connected domains are in scope and CNAME'd to a subdomain like:
groupXX.sites.hscoscdnYY.net, where XX and YY are the numeric identifiers for the content path.
In Scope Vulnerabilities
In general, vulnerabilities thought to be introduced by HubSpot's hosting platform, and therefore may affect multiple HubSpot customers, are in-scope for this program. Please report those here. Vulnerabilities that are not HubSpot-introduced will still be investigated and will be reported to the affected customer, but they are not rewardable.
Cross-site scripting (XSS)
XSS found while authenticated to the app are only eligible for a reward if it executes in the context of hubspot.com. XSS found on default system domains (eg. hs-sites or hubspotpagebuilder) are only eligible for a reward if all of the below criteria are met:
XSS also executes on the connected domain
The XSS was introduced by HubSpot
We’ve received XSS submissions on customer sites caused by a vulnerable HubL or JavaScript code written by the customer in the Design Manager. Those are not rewardable.
We will make exceptions to these rules for any XSS submitted with an exploit that shows clear security impact to the HubSpot platform.
Subdomain takeovers
HubSpot owns thousands of subdomains. Researchers who submit a valid subdomain takeover will be rewarded at either P2 or P3 level, depending on impact.
Subdomain takeover reports are in scope only if they meet the following criteria:
You must include proof that the subdomain is owned by HubSpot.
You must demonstrate proof-of-concept by hosting a simple, nonmalicious html file under the taken-over subdomain.
Insecure direct object references (IDORs)
Cross-portal IDORs or privilege escalation issues that allow unauthorized access to sensitive data, different customer portals, or administrative functions are eligible for rewards and will be prioritized based on their impact.
Same-portal IDORs on the HubSpot app where a low-privileged user accesses higher-privileged APIs may be eligible for rewards depending on the impact and data accessed.
Higher Priority IDORs (eligible for standard rewards):
Cross-portal data access or leakage
Access to sensitive properties or PHI/PII data
Financial, billing, or payment information access
Privilege escalation to Super Admin functions
User account takeover capabilities
Lower Priority/Informational IDORs (may be marked as informational):
Basic CRUD operations on non-sensitive objects within the same portal
Sharing/permission modifications on non-sensitive content
A same portal IDOR submission may not be eligible for a reward if:
We determine that the low-privileged user is granted the necessary scope to perform a function.
The owning team decides it is working as designed. Often, this means that if the IDOR is fixed other functionalities within the app will break.
It’s a previously accepted (and documented) risk. E.g. Users without User table access are still able to view a list of users elsewhere in their HubSpot account as documented here.
Note: We reserve the right to mark authorization bypass issues as informational when they involve low-impact administrative functions, even if they represent a technical violation of intended permissions. This allows our team to focus resources on higher-impact security issues while still acknowledging valid findings.
Out Of Scope Vulnerabilities:
The following submission types are excluded from the bounty and therefore not rewardable:
Reports related to the rate limits applied to an API endpoint
Login or Forgot Password page brute force
Denial of service attacks
Perceived excessive volumes of sent email (e.g., mail flooding)
Race condition bugs that bypass subscription limits
Social-engineering of any kind against HubSpot employees or its users
Vulnerable libraries without a working proof-of-concept
Clickjacking
Absent or misconfigured HTTP headers
Missing best-practice bugs that don’t pose a direct/immediate risk to our company or our users (e.g. missing certificate authority authorization)
XSS that don’t execute in the context of *.hubspot.com or customer connected domains, and instead only executes on preview domains like hs-sites.com, hubspotpagebuilder.com, hubspotpreview.com, cdn.hubspot.net, and similar domains. These domains are intentionally designed to host untrusted user-supplied data.
